# Deep Segmentation Features for Weakly Supervised Disease Classification via 3D Dual-Stage CNN 

**Problem Statement**: Weakly supervised 3D classification of multi-organ, multi-disease CT scans. 

**Data**: *Class A*: Diseased Lungs Cases (Pneumonia-Atelectasis, Emphysema, Nodules, Mass); *Class B:* Normal Lungs Cases.

## Network Architecture  
  
  
![Network Architecture](reports/images/network_architecture.png)*Figure 1.  Integrated model architecture for reusing segmentation feature maps in 3D binary classification. The segmentation sub-model is a DenseVNet, taking a variable input volume with a single channel and the classification sub-model is a 3D ResNet, taking an input volume patch of size [112,112,112] with 2 channels. Final output is a tensor with the predicted class probabilities.*
